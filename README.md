# About
The Inventory System is a comprehensive web-based solution developed as a thesis project for Senior High School at Golden Minds Colleges, Sta. Maria Campus, Bulacan. This project fulfills the requirements of the **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** strand and aims to enhance the management of HRM tools and equipment inventories. The system provides a structured and automated approach to inventory management, including dynamic report generation. It comprises four key modules: Account Management, Tracking Management, Transaction Management, and Report Generation.

During Grade 12, I led my group in developing this Inventory System for HRM Tools and Equipment. Our dedication and innovative approach were recognized, earning our project the title of **Best Thesis for Innovation**. This system has since been adopted by Golden Minds Colleges as their main inventory management tool and is actively used within the institution.

### Expected Outcomes

The Inventory System is designed to deliver a reliable and efficient solution for managing HRM tools and equipment. The key expected outcomes and features include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface that simplifies inventory tasks for users.
2. **Tracking System:** A robust tracking mechanism that monitors the location and status of tools and equipment in real-time.
3. **Transaction System:** A comprehensive system for managing the borrowing and returning of tools and equipment, ensuring accurate records.
4. **Reporting System:** A dynamic reporting module that generates essential reports for stakeholders, facilitating data-driven decisions.
5. **Alert System:** An alert feature that notifies stakeholders of low stock levels, equipment damage, or other critical updates.
6. **Mailing System:** Integrated email functionality to notify users about important system activities or required actions.
