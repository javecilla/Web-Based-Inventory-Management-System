# Web-Based Inventory Management for Golden Minds Colleges

I developed the Web-Based Inventory System as a thesis project during my Senior High School at Golden Minds Colleges, Sta. Maria Campus, Bulacan. This project fulfills the requirements of the **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** strand and provides a structured and automated approach to managing HRM tools and equipment inventories.

## Key Features  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation.  
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitors the location and status of tools and equipment.  
- **Transaction Management**: Handles borrowing, returning, and inventory updates.  
- **Dynamic Report Generation**: Provides essential reports for data-driven decisions.  
- **Automated Alerts**: Notifies users of low stock, damaged equipment, or critical updates.  
- **Integrated Mailing System**: Sends email notifications for important actions.  

## Development Journey  
During **Grade 12**, I led my group in developing this system, focusing on innovation and usability. Our dedication and technical approach earned us the **Best Thesis for Innovation** award. The system has since been officially adopted by Golden Minds Colleges as their primary inventory management tool.

## Technical Stack  
- **Backend**: PHP for API development and server-side logic.  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript and CSS for a responsive and interactive UI.  
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage and efficient retrieval.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a HostGator. 

This project refined my skills in **full-stack development**, particularly in designing **efficient database structures** and implementing **real-time tracking systems**.
